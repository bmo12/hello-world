# hello-world

Hey All!

My deep dive into the world of code begins! My new found passion came from the ability to turn off the world and sit in front of my computer for hours on end without ever talking to anyone. Dreams do come true! I think the bonus is i'm learning to create some pretty cool things, and see my ideas come to life. 

Over and out!
